LYRICS: 

magnetic attraction 
mutual satisfaction 
first sight, love at eye contact 
i love it that our passion is such a high contrast 
to the possessiveness that limited our loveships in the past 


chorus 1: 

i'm a bird who sings in the springtime 
she's a girl who smiles like the sunrise 
though i love the days when she's all mine 
i don't try to bottle her sunshine 

loving, crushing-she sees me staring 
baby maybe loving is sharing 
feel the wind of love on the sky 
i'm a bird that can't help but fly 


i can't fit inside monogamy's philosophies 
of one and only constantly 
stopping me from boundlessly 
expressing what is possibly 

the greatest force in all of me 
my heart cannot be property 
ownership is opposite 
of all that love has taught to me 

the infinite capacity 
of each of us to happily 
surrender to the majesty 
of learning love's true mastery 

each one of us a tapestry 
anatomy like galaxies 
it’s fallacy i’d need someone 
complete the other half of me 

reality is many souls 
reflect my whole totality 
complexity, vitality 
my sensual mentality 

rather than analogies 
of draining like a battery 
the more and more i practice love 
the more my love grows naturally 

i know a few interpreters 
think jealousy is flattery 
I avidly promote we try 
to rise up from the agony 
try out a brand new strategy 
flip envy into ecstasy 
amplified through alchemy 


chorus 2: 

i'm a bird who sings in the springtime 
she's a girl who smiles like the sunrise 
though i love the days when she's all mine 
i don't try to bottle her sunshine 

got a feeling girl go express it 
love is never love when possessive 
feel the wind of love on the sky 
she's a bird that can't help but fly 


if a girl ask you to dance-then dance with the girl 
if it feels right, then you should hold hands with the girl 
cuz i believe that god is love and love she keeps telling me 
to step back, relax and deconstruct your jealousy 

cuz jealousy is fear-some days i'm scared of losing you 
but you and i are free to leave if we choose to 
i'm taking down the bricks of this invisible wall 
and when the wind of love blows, now we both can feel it all cuz 

you love to hear me sing, even if you didn't write the note 
i love to hear you laugh, even if i didn't tell the joke 
you know i love to cuddle, love to pull your body close 
and i love it when you're happy even if i have to let you go 

cuz if you need your space then baby you can let me know 
i'll you from afar you my star in a telescope 
i'm not a god, i'm not a fool but I would be both 
to think that love was something i could control 


chorus 3: 

i'm a bird who sings in the springtime 
she's a girl who smiles like the sunrise 
though i love the days when she's all mine 
i don't try to bottle her sunshine 

trusting, loving, true understanding 
universe of us is expanding 
feel the wind of love on the sky 
we are a birds that can't help but fly 


i love how your empathy 
finds joy inside my intimacy 
with someone else that's into me 
love is limitless, infinity 

i love it how my loyalty 
dissolves your insecurity 
our love it blooms concurrently 
you know that's my priority 

i'm soaring through an odyssey 
deep in the realms of honesty 
with conscious choreography 
consensual autonomy 

equality, responsibly 
i feel our trust it waters me 
a love like this is selflessly 
fulfilling like a prophecy 

cuz there's no better way to love me than thru honesty and trusting it's 
not indiscriminate fucking, it's indiscriminate loving 
its rizing up to realize that love's your greatest gift to me 
it's lifting me above the narrow space of normativity 
now we are one and i am free and you can take the sky with me 
cuz love is phoenix flying rise up above to feel the breeze 
some days will be a struggle and some will fly by with ease but i 
would love it if you trust to claim this journey with me 


chorus 4: 

i'm a bird who sings in the springtime 
she's a girl who smiles like the sunrise 
though i love the days when she's all mine 
i don't try to bottle her sunshine 

got a feeling girl go express it 
love is never love when possessive 
feel the wind of love on the sky 
she's a bird that can't help but fly 


look right at me baby 
let’s make eye contact 
you trust in me, i trust in you 
there’s no doubt bout that 
our hearts have grown vast 
I know our love’s gon last 
cause soul to soul we touching 
through this eye contact
